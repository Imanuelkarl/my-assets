Subject: Licensing Terms and Usage Rights for 3D Model Render
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to formally clarify the licensing terms and usage rights concerning the 3D model render I provided to you on 7th April 2025. As of now, no payment has been received for the work delivered. Please note the following licensing conditions:
1.	Copyright & Usage Restriction:
I retain full copyright over the 3D model and its rendered image. Until full payment is received, the image must not be used for any commercial, promotional, or public-facing purposes.
2.	Payment Deadline & Penalty:
If payment is not made within 30 days from the delivery date, a 20% increase will be applied to the agreed payment amount for every additional 30-day delay.
3.	Part-Payment Condition:
If a part payment of at least 60% of the agreed price is made within the 30-day window, the percentage penalty will no longer apply. However, the image may still not be used commercially or publicly until full payment is received.
4.	Unauthorized Use:
Any use, distribution, or modification of the image or 3D model without fulfilling the payment and licensing terms stated above will constitute copyright infringement and may result in formal legal action or takedown notices.
I believe in fair and respectful collaborations, and I trust this matter will be resolved promptly. Kindly confirm receipt of this message and your intention moving forward.
Sincerely,
Emmanuel Dozie
